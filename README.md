ðŸš€ Life is too short for all the new "React" frameworks, so let's rewrite all in Rust!

Oh wait... whats these? ðŸ’€

```
error[E0597]: `job` does not live long enough
error[E0599]: no method named `get_a_job` found for type `std::result::Result<Asian, failure::error::Error>` in the current scope
```

Nevermind. Let's rewrite again in Zig!
