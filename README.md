ðŸš€ Life is too short for all the new "React" frameworks, so let's rewrite everything in Rust!

Oh wait... ðŸ’€

```
error[E0597]: `social_life` does not live long enough
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier for `work_life_balance`
error[E0599]: no method named `touch_grass` found for type `Developer`
```

Nevermind. Let's rewrite everything in Zig! 

```
error: TypeNotFoundError: cannot find type 'Sleep' in scope
error: expected '};', found 'Coffee'
error: unused variable 'weekend'
comptime error: cannot evaluate this expression at compile-time: `sanity`
```
